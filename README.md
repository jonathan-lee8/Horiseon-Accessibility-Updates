# Horiseon Accessibility Updates

Improved website's accessibility by ensuring all links are fully functional, the code follows semantic HTML elements, accessible alternative attributes in the case our images do not load, and that our heading fall into sequential order. Our title is based on the company name to allow users to remember the tab labeled in case they are in another. Also cleaned CSS stylesheet to reduce amount of class selectors labeled for a concise sheet.
